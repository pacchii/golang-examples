The ancient, moss-covered stone bridge stretched quietly across the narrow,
rushing river, acting as a forgotten passage between the dense forest and the sunlit meadow.
Visitors often paused there to listen to the water singing over smooth pebbles,
a stark contrast to the distant, bustling city. For centuries,
this bridge held countless stories, witnessing changing seasons and silent,
passing moments of nature's, and humanity's, fleeting history.
